In the bustling streets of modern society, you, a young man,
navigate the routine of everyday life.
Little do you know, an extraordinary fate awaits.
One seemingly ordinary day, as you cross the familiar roadways,
the sudden screech of tires pierces the air.
The world blurs as a truck careens towards you,
an unforeseen force propelling you into the unknown.

In the blink of an eye, the sights and sounds of the city vanish,
replaced by an otherworldly landscape.
You awaken in a realm untouched by familiarity,
surrounded by mystical landscapes and inhabited by creatures beyond imagination.
The air crackles with magic,
and a newfound energy courses through your veins.

As you rise from the ground,
you realize that the collision with the truck was not an end but a portal to a realm teeming with wonder and danger.
Your adventure in this isekai world begins, and the choices you make will shape your destiny.
What path will you tread in this fantastical land? Embrace the unknown and forge your tale in a world unlike any other.

would you like
to continue??

while you are in daze you hear a voice
do you want to open your panel and see your stats?

suddenly you hear a voice in a bush nearbay
a slime jump out of nowhere

do you wish to fight it?

after a not so tough fight you slayed the slime and it
dropped an item it's just a rusted sword but you think to yourself
well better then nothing

do you wish to pick the sword?

Suddenly you hear the system prompt again do you wish
to activate  the navigation systeme to go to the nearest town?

while your looking around you found a party that is heading
to clear a new dungeon that spawned nearby

do you wish to join them?

you went to the dungeon while you are a noob
the party leader was a cool guy

he didn't put too much burden on you and just left you to
carry stuff around

while the party is fighting suddenly a zombie showed up out of
nowhere

fight the zombie?

suddenly you find yourself in front of a giant stone gate
your party pushed open the gate with wild dreams of riches behind
the door

you enter a pitch black room suddenly you hear the stone door
close behind you and all the torches on the walls light up
in the same time

you found yourself staring at a giant statue and the room is
filled with more giant statues but not as big as the one
sitting on chair infront of you

suddenly one of your party sees a stone tablet written on
it carthenon Temaple commandments:
first worship the lord
second praise the lord
third prove your faith
those who do not follow these commandments will never return alive

do you wish to reread the commandments?
